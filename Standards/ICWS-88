                                                The Text of the Proposal

                                          MARS Functional Units.

                                          From the Redcode programmer's point of
                                          view, MARS is composed of four primary
                                          functional units:  a read/write memory
                                          (RAM),  a  computing  unit  (ALU), two
                                          process  queues   (FIFO's),   and  the
                                          control  unit  (CU).    There  are  no
                                          registers visible  to  the programmer;
                                          that  is,  memory  is the only storage
                                          available  for  both  instructions and
                                          data.

                                          RAM:  All  Redcode instructions occupy
                                          exactly    one     memory    location.
                                          Addressing in  Redcode is relative, so
                                          it is best to think of memory as being
                                          organised  as   a  circular  list;  an
                                          instruction  that   references  memory
                                          location zero  is referring to itself.
                                          Every RAM location  is  initialised to
                                          the data  pattern which corresponds to
                                          the instruct DAT  0  0  before loading
                                          any  Core   War  programs,  (elsewhere
                                          refered to as "warriors").

                                          FIFO: A game of Core War  is played by
                                          pitting  two  Redcode programs against
                                          each other.   Each  attempts  to force
                                          the  other  to  fail  by causing it to
                                          execute  a  "halt"  instruction,  (the
                                          DAT).   During each  machine cycle one
                                          instruction  from   each   program  is
                                          executed,  always  in  the same order.
                                          it is  thus  necessary  to  maintain a
                                          program counter  for each  side.  This
                                          is the purpose of  the process queues.
                                          As  will   be  seen,   each  side  may
                                          consist  of  more  than  one  process.
                                          This is  why a  FIFO and  not a single
                                          register is necessary  for  each side.
                                          There are  no upper or lower limits to
                                          the  size  of  the  FIFO's,  save  the
                                          minimum of one each, as battles cannot
                                          occur  with  less  than  two  Core War
