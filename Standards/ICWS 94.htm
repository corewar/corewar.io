<h3>Stephen's intro to the HTML draft</h3>In linking the table of contents to 
the document, I noticed a couple of numbering errors. To wit, the test suites 
(which haven't been filled in, anyway) weren't numbered the same in the TOC and 
in the body. I changed the TOC to reflect the body's numbering, since it made 
more sense. Also, in the Glossary, the entry for Dwarf has two references to 
that program's appearance. The second reference used to be 3.6, but that section 
doesn't exist. I changed it to read 3.5 (where the program actually appears). 
These changes take place on lines 65-80 and on line 1446.

<h3>Stefan's intro to ver. 3.2</h3>The sample simulator was rewritten 
extensively based on suggestions by Damien Doligez ("Planar") and on our 
experience implemementing the pMARS, the first ICWS'94 simulator. Thanks to 
Planar and also Steven Morrell for pointing out many omissions and ambiguities 
in the previous revision. Other readers of rec.games.corewar have also provided 
many helpful comments.

<h3>Mark's intro to ver. 3.1</h3>The information presented here is not part of 
the Draft proper. <a href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/%7Epizza/koth/icws94.html#draft">The Draft 
proper immediately follows these annotations, beginning with the line "0001 
Draft of Proposed 1994 Core War Standard".</a> The content lines of the Draft 
proper are numbered for easy reference. The numbers may or may not be included 
in the final Draft.
<p>Internal annotations were removed to clean-up the draft for presentation to 
the ICWS for comment. These annotations which precede the draft take their 
place.
</p><p>Open-ended references were removed to clean-up the draft for presentation to 
the ICWS for comment. The question of the inclusion or exclusion of various 
opcodes, modes, etc. has not been closed as of yet. Such additions or deletions 
should be finalized by the next draft however.
</p><p>Previously speculative references were either included or removed to clean-up 
the draft for presentation to the ICWS for comment. See above.
</p><p>The Load File section was rewritten to aid in the readability of load files. 
It was deemed best that Load Files be a subset of Assembly Files; therefore Load 
Files should logically follow the Assembly File section. For that reason, the 
two sections have been swapped.
</p><p>Example MARS code is now included. Other parts of the standard, such as 
validation, remain incomplete. The remaining incomplete sections do not impact 
on the other sections of the standard and so can be completed even after 
consideration of the rest of the draft by the ICWS. Alternatively, they could be 
issued as separate documents.
</p><p>The MARS code is specifically designed to mirror the draft as closely as 
possible. There is a multitude of optimizations which could have been made but 
were not in order that the example code could serve as a possible clarification 
of obscure parts of the draft. Do not suggest changes to the example code which 
speed up processing at the expense of mirroring the draft.
</p><p>Several changes have been made with the goal of expanding the flexibility of 
Core War without compromising backwards compatibility and without seriously 
altering the nature of the game. In that vein:
</p><p>The modulus '%' operator was added to the Assembly File section.
</p><p>Read and Write limitations with folding have been clarified. These limits 
allow the possibility of warriors essentially running in a mini-core inside 
core, folding out-of-bounds access attempts back into accessible memory. The 
main advantages to folding are: old-style bombers like Dwarf do not unfairly and 
unknowingly spend cycles doing nothing, and movement to seek and destroy enemy 
warriors is still encouraged by the limits. The main disadvantage is that limits 
which are not factors of the size of core lead to unexpected results. Example: a 
reference to address location -1 is adjusted to M-1 when loaded into core and 
will not fold to R-1 and/or W-1 if R or W are not factors of M (M is size of 
core, R is the read limit, and W is the write limit). Of course, if R = W = M, 
then play is equivalent to ICWS'88 without limits.
</p><p>In the 5.MARS section of the draft, many of the terms such as A-operand were 
used both as containers ("Writes to the A-operand") and the contents of those 
containers ("Compare the A-operand to ..."). Such ambiguous terms and references 
have hopefully been eradicated.
</p><p>Although such eradication eliminates ambiguity, it encourages obfuscation 
and/or the proliferation of terms. A delicate balance has, perhaps, been struck 
between the two.
</p><p>The following are terms which are new or may be used differently than in the 
past. All terms are contents (not containers).
</p><ul>
  <li>opcode modifier : Removes mode-specific behaviour from opcodes by 
  explicitly stating whether an instruction uses just one number, two numbers, 
  or a whole instruction. 
  </li><li>A-number : Replaces A-field/A-value/A-term, etc. A general term, not tied 
  to any specific instruction. 
  </li><li>B-number : Replaces B-field/B-value/B-term, etc. A general term, not tied 
  to any specific instruction. 
  </li><li>current instruction : Specifically means the instruction in the 
  instruction register. Does NOT mean the instruction in core pointed to by the 
  pointer counter. (That instruction may have changed since the current 
  instruction was copied from there). 
  </li><li>A-instruction : Specifically means the copy of the instruction in core (at 
  the time of A-operand evaluation) pointed to by the A-pointer. 
  </li><li>B-instruction : Specifically means the copy of the instruction in core (at 
  the time of B-operand evaluation) pointed to by the B-pointer. 
  </li><li>A-value : Now refers to the object(s) (A/B-number(s) of the A-instruction 
  or the A-instruction) referenced by the A-operand (as selected by the opcode 
  modifier). 
  </li><li>B-value : Now refers to the object(s) (A/B-number(s) of the B-instruction 
  or the B-instruction) referenced by the B-operand (as selected by the opcode 
  modifier). 
  </li><li>B-target: The object(s) (A/B-number(s) of the instruction in core [at the 
  time of opcode execution] or the instruction) pointed to by the 
B-pointer.</li></ul>
<p>Six opcode modifiers have been added to the Draft. Modifiers are appended to 
the opcodes with a dot. Example: "MOV.A". The modifiers are:
</p><ul>
  <li>.A Instructions use and write A-numbers. 
  </li><li>.B Instructions use and write B-numbers. 
  </li><li>.AB Instructions use the A-numbers of the A-instructions and the B-numbers 
  of the B-instructions and write B-numbers. 
  </li><li>.BA Instructions use the B-numbers of the A-instructions and the A-numbers 
  of the B-instructions and write A-numbers. 
  </li><li>.F Instructions use both the A-numbers and the B-numbers, using and 
  writing A-to-A, B-to-B. 
  </li><li>.X Instructions use both the A-numbers and the B-numbers, using and 
  writing A-to-B, B-to-A. 
  </li><li>.I Instructions use and write entire instructions.</li></ul>See Section 5.4 
for more information (especially the examples).
<p>There could be modifiers (other than .I) which take the modes into account, 
but their utility may not warrant their inclusion.
</p><p>The advantages of opcode modifiers include: greatly expanding the function of 
opcodes without greatly expanding the number of opcodes, separating opcode 
evaluation from operand evaluation (i.e. the behaviours of the opcodes no longer 
depend on the modes), rendering moot questions about whether ADD, SUB, etc. 
should use one or two fields (and if one field, whether to use the A-field or 
the B-field), adding versatility to the order of task splitting, and providing a 
"Skip if greater than" equivalent to SLT.
</p><p>In addition, backwards compatibility with ICWS'88 (and even ICWS'86) is 
easily accomplished at the assembly level. Any instructions with opcodes without 
modifiers would be translated to the appropriate opcode.modifier pair. Examples:
</p><p>"MOV #a, B", which only moves the A-field of the current instruction to the 
B-field of the instruction pointed to by B, would be translated to "MOV.AB #a, 
B". Similarly, "MOV a, b", which moves an entire instruction from A to B, 
becomes "MOV.I a, b". Instructions which were previously impossible, such as 
moving a B-field to an A-field, are now very simple and intuitive with "MOV.BA 
A, B". Another example, "MOV.X target, target" takes the place of "XCH target", 
exchanging fields. Finally, "ADD a, b" would translate to "ADD.F a, b" for 
ICWS'88 and "ADD.B a, b" for ICWS'86.
</p><p>There is one negative to one opcode modifier. ".I" only really makes sense 
for MOV and CMP. It would be possible to define results for arithmetic 
manipulation and ordinal comparison of opcodes and modes, but it would be very 
artificial. As an alternative, .I falls back to .F functionality (for opcodes 
other than MOV and CMP) in this document.
</p><p>Things which absolutely must be done before final consideration for adoption 
by the ICWS:
</p><ol>
  <li>Complete incomplete sections or remove references to them 
  </li><li>Add typographic distinctions to grammars</li></ol>To aid in completion of 
the draft, all suggested revisions of the draft should consist of explicit 
remarks such as:
<ul>
  <li>Delete lines xxxx to yyyy 
  </li><li>Add the following after line zzzz .... 
  </li><li>Replace lines vvvv to wwww with ....</li></ul>Please individually explain 
why each revision is necessary.
<p>The maximal verbosity of the draft is intentional. Each sentence either 
presents a new item, a clarification of an item, or an old item in a new 
context. The goal is that no two reasonable people could arrive at two different 
interpretations of the draft.

0091 <a name="1.1">1.1</a> Purpose
0092 This standard seeks to fully define and describe the game of Core War.
     
0093 <a name="1.2">1.2</a> Overview
0094 Core War is a game in which programs compete for control of a computer
0095 called MARS (for Memory Array Redcode Simulator).  Redcode is the name
0096 of the assembly language in which Core War programs, called warriors,
0097 are written.
     
0098 In order to play Core Wars, access to a Core War system is required.
0099 A Core War system at a minimum must have a MARS executive function
0100 (interpreter) and a way to load warriors into core (the MARS memory).
0101 Most systems include a Redcode assembler, either separately or as part
0102 of the loader.  Also, many systems include a graphical interface and
0103 code debugging features.  Some systems have the ability to run
0104 automated tournaments.

0106 This document is the fourth standard for Core War, the first three
0107 being "Core War Guidelines" (March 1984) by D. G. Jones and
0108 A. K. Dewdney, the International Core War Society standard of 1986 -
0109 "Core Wars" (May 1986), principally authored by Graeme McRae and the
0110 "Core Wars Standard of 1988" (Summer 1988), principally authored by
0111 Thomas Gettys.  The latter two standards are often referred to as
0112 ICWS'86 and ICWS'88, respectively.

0129 <a name="2.0">2.</a> Redcode Assembly File Format
     
0130 <a name="2.1">2.1</a> Purpose
0131 A Redcode assembly file consists of the information necessary for a
0132 Redcode assembler to produce a load file.  A standard assembly file
0133 format allows programmers to exchange warriors in a more meaningful
0134 format than load files.  An assembly file, through the use of labels,
0135 arithmetic expressions, and macros can also greatly reduce the work
0136 necessary to produce a particular warrior while enhancing code
0137 readability.
     
0138 <a name="2.2">2.2</a> Description
0139 Each Redcode warrior consists of one or more lines of Redcode.  Each
0140 line of Redcode consists of a string of alphanumerals and special
0141 characters.  Special characters in Redcode are the addressing mode
0142 indicators for immediate '#', direct '$', indirect '@', predecrement
0143 indirect '&lt;', and postincrement indirect '&gt;' modes, the field
0144 separator (comma) ',', the comment indicator (semicolon) ';', the
0145 arithmetic operators for addition '+', subtraction '-', multiplication
0146 '*', division '/', and  modulus '%', and opening '(' and closing ')'
0147 parentheses for precedence grouping.
     
0148 A line may be blank or consist of an instruction, a
0149 pseudo-instruction, a comment, or an instruction or
0150 pseudo-instruction followed by a comment.  Each line is terminated
0151 with a newline.  All comments begin with a semicolon.  Each
0152 instruction consists of these elements in the following order: a
0153 label, an opcode, an A-operand, a comma, and a B-operand.  Each
0154 element may be preceded and/or followed by whitespace other than a
0155 newline.  The label is optional.  If either operand is blank, the
0156 comma may be omitted.
     
0157 Pseudo-instructions appear just like instructions but are directives
0158 to the assembler and do not result in object code as an instruction
0159 would.  Each pseudo-instruction has a pseudo-opcode which appears
0160 where an opcode would appear in an instruction.  The format of the
0161 remainder of the pseudo-instruction depends on which pseudo-opcode is
0162 used.  For the remainder of this section (2.2) and the next (2.3),
0163 references to "opcode" include "pseudo-opcode" assembler directives.
     
0164 A label is any alphanumeric string other than those reserved for
0165 opcodes.  Labels are case sensitive, i.e. "start" is different from
0166 "Start".  An opcode is any of the following: DAT, MOV, ADD, SUB, MUL,
0167 DIV, MOD, JMP, JMZ, JMN, DJN, CMP, SLT, or SPL.  Opcodes may be in
0168 upper or lower case or any combination.  An opcode may be followed by
0169 a modifier.  A modifier always begins with a dot.  A modifier is any
0170 of the following: .A, .B, .AB, .BA, .F, .X, or .I.  Modifiers may be
0171 in upper or lower case or any combination.
     
0172 Each operand is blank, contains an address, or contains an addressing
0173 mode indicator and an address.  An address consists of any number of
0174 labels and numbers separated by arithmetic operators and possibly
0175 grouped with parentheses.  All elements of an address may be separated
0176 by whitespace.
     
0177 <a name="2.3">2.3</a> Grammar
0178 Tokens are separated by whitespace (space and tab) exclusive of
0179 newline characters, which are used for line termination.  End-of-file
0180 should occur only where newline could logically occur, otherwise the
0181 load file has been terminated prematurely.
     
0182 In the following, 'e' is the "empty" element, meaning the token may be
0183 omitted, a caret '^' means NOT, an asterisk '*' immediately adjacent
0184 means zero or more occurrences of the previous token, and a plus '+'
0185 immediately adjacent means one or more occurrences of the previous
0186 token.  The vertical bar '|' means OR.

0238 <a name="2.4">2.4</a> Assembly To Load File Conversion
0239 A Redcode program can be assembled into a list of MARS instructions.
0240 (When assembled to a file instead of directly to core, the list is
0241 called a load file.  See Section 3).  Each Redcode instruction
0242 assembles into a MARS instruction of five fields: an opcode.modifier
0243 field, the A-mode field, the A-address field, the B-mode field, and
0244 the B-address field.  A missing (null or blank) mode assembles as '$'
0245 does.
     
0246 If no modifier is present in the assembly instruction, the appropriate
0247 modifier is appended to the opcode.  The appropriate modifier depends
0248 upon the opcode, the modes, and which standard (ICWS'86 or ICWS'88) to
0249 consider (ICWS'88 by default).  See Appendix A for the appropriate
0250 translations.
     
0251 The address field values are derived from the numbers, labels, and
0252 arithmetic operators contained in the addresses.  Labels are
0253 converted to an address relative to the current instruction.  Then
0254 the arithmetic operations are carried out according to the
0255 appropriate operator and parenthetical precedence to determine the
0256 final value.  If there is only one operand associated with a DAT
0257 instruction, this operand is assembled into the B-mode and B-address
0258 fields, while #0 is assembled into the A-mode and A-address fields.
0259 For all other instructions with only one operand, this operand is
0260 assembled into the A-mode and A-address fields and #0 is assembled
0261 into the B-mode and B-address fields.
     
0262 <a name="2.5">2.5</a> Pseudo-instructions
0263 Pseudo-opcodes are "ORG", "EQU", and "END".
     
0264 "ORG" ("ORiGin") is a way for the assembly file to indicate the 
0265 logical origin of the warrior.  The A-operand contains an offset to 
0266 the logical first instruction.  Thus "ORG 0" means execution should 
0267 start with the first instruction (the default) whereas "ORG 6" means 
0268 execution should start with the seventh instruction. Although multiple 
0269 ORG instructions are of no additional benefit to the programmer, they 
0270 are allowed. When there is more than one ORG instruction in a file, 
0271 the last ORG instruction encountered will be the one that takes 
0272 effect.
     
0273 "EQU" ("EQUate") is a simple text substitution utility.  Instructions
0274 of the form "label EQU text" will replace all occurrences of "label"
0275 with the (probably longer and more complicated) "text" before any
0276 actual assembly takes place on the file.
     
0277 "END" indicates the logical end of the assembly file.  If END has an
0278 A-operand, then the A-operand indicates the logical origin of the
0279 warrior in the same manner as ORG does. No instruction following END
0280 should be assembled.
     
     
0281 <a name="2.6">2.6</a> Comment Conventions
0282 ";redcode<switch>" as a first line identifies the file as a Redcode
0283 assembly file.  The "<switch>" is optional and implementation
0284 dependent.
     
0285 ";strategy <text>" indicates a comment for "public" consumption.
     
0286 ";name <program name="">", ";author <name author(s)="" of="">",
0287 ";version <version number="">", and ";date <date of="" revision="" last="">"
0288 offer uniform ways of presenting this information.
     
0289 ";kill <program name="">" is for removing warriors from ongoing
0290 tournaments.  If no <program name=""> is supplied, all of the author's
0291 previous submissions will be removed.

0310 <a name="3.0">3.</a> Load File Format
     
0311 <a name="3.1">3.1</a> Purpose
0312 A load file represents the minimum amount of information necessary for
0313 a warrior to execute properly and is presented in a very simple format
0314 which is a subset of the assembly file format presented in Section 2.
0315 A standard load file format allows programmers to choose assemblers
0316 and MARS programs separately and to verify assembler performance and
0317 MARS performance separately.  Not all Core War systems will necessarily
0318 write load files (for example, those which assemble directly to core),
0319 but all systems should support reading load files.
     
0320 <a name="3.2">3.2</a> Description
     
0321 Each load file will consist of one or more lines of MARS
0322 instructions or comments.  Each line is terminated with a newline.
0323 All comments start with with a semicolon.  Each MARS instruction
0324 consists of five fields: an opcode.modifier pair, an A-mode, an
0325 A-field, a B-mode, and a B-field.  The A-mode is separated from the
0326 opcode.modifier pair by whitespace and the B-mode is separated from
0327 the A-field by a comma and additional whitespace.  Each MARS
0328 instruction may be followed by extraneous information, which is
0329 ignored.  Note that the instruction format for load files is more
0330 rigid than for assemply files to simplify parsing. No blank modes or
0331 operands are allowed.
     
     
0332 <a name="3.3">3.3</a> Grammar
0333 Tokens are separated by whitespace (non-marking characters such as
0334 SPACE and TAB) exclusive of newline characters, which are used for
0335 line termination.  End-of-file should occur only where newline could
0336 logically occur, otherwise the load file has been terminated
0337 prematurely.

0370 <a name="3.4">3.4</a> Comment Conventions
0371 Comment conventions for load files are the same as for assembly files.
0372 Of particular note are the "; name <program name="">" and "; author
0373 <author(s)>" comments.  These comments provide a more suitable
0374 identification of programs to the MARS than "Warrior #1", "Warrior #2",
0375 etc.  It also allows for less cryptic identification than by filename.

0390 <a name="4.0">4.</a> Run-time Variables
     
0391 <a name="4.1">4.1</a> Purpose
0392 This section describes those variables which are determined just prior
0393 to running a battle by the person running the battle.  It also
0394 enumerates some of the standardized sets of variables used for
0395 tournaments.
     
0396 <a name="4.2">4.2</a> Variables
0397 Run-time variables consist of the following:
     
0398 Core Size:
0399         Core size is the number of instructions which make up core
0400         during the battle.
     
0401 Cycles Before Tie:
0402         In each cycle, one instruction from each warrior is executed.
0403         This variable determines how many cycles without a winner
0404         should be executed before declaring a tie.
     
0405 Initial Instruction:
0406         The initial instruction is that instruction which is preloaded
0407         into core prior to loading warriors.  In addition to loading
0408         an instruction such as "DAT #0, #0" into all of core, the
0409         initial instruction could be set to "NONE", meaning core should
0410         not be cleared between battles, or "RANDOM", meaning core
0411         instructions are filled with randomly generated instructions.
     
0412 Instruction Limit:
0413         The maximum number of instructions allowed per load file.
     
0414 Maximum Number of Tasks:
0415         Each warrior can spawn multiple additional tasks.  This
0416         variable sets the maximum number of tasks allowed per warrior.
0417         In other words, this is the size of each warrior's task queue.
     
0418 Minimum Separation:
0419         The minimum number of instructions from the first instruction
0420         of one warrior to the first instruction of the next warrior.
     
0421 Read Distance:
0422         This is the range available for warriors to read information
0423         from core.  Attempts to read outside the limits of this range
0424         result in reading within the local readable range.  The range
0425         is centered on the current instruction.  Thus, a range of
0426         500 limits reading to offsets of (-249 -&gt; +250) from the
0427         currently executing instruction.  The read limit can therefore
0428         be considered a mini-core within core.  An attempt to read
0429         location PC+251 reads location PC-249 instead.  An attempt to
0430         read location PC+500 reads location PC instead.
     
0431         Read distance must be a factor of core size, otherwise the
0432         above defined behaviour is not guaranteed.
     
0433 Separation:
0434         The number of instructions from the first instruction of one
0435         warrior to the first instruction of the next warrior.
0436         Separation can be set to "RANDOM", meaning separations will be
0437         chosen randomly from those larger than the minimum separation.
     
0438 Warriors:
0439         The initial number of warriors to battle simultaneously in
0440         core.
     
0441 Write Distance:
0442         This is the range available for warriors to write information
0443         to core.  Attempts to write outside the limits of this range
0444         result in writing within the local writable range.  The range
0445         is centered on the current instruction.  Thus, a range of 500
0446         limits writing to offsets of (-249 -&gt; +250) from the
0447         currently executing instruction.  The write limit can
0448         therefore be considered a mini-core within core.  An attempt 
0449         to write location PC+251 writes to location PC-249 instead.  
0450         An attempt to write to location PC+500 writes to location PC 
0451         instead.
     
0452         Write distance must be a factor of core size, otherwise the
0453         above defined behaviour is not guaranteed.

0477 <a name="5.0">5.</a> MARS
     
0478 <a name="5.1">5.1</a> Purpose
0479 The Memory Array Redcode Simulator (MARS) is the computer in which
0480 Core War warriors do combat.
     
0481 <a name="5.2">5.2</a> Description
0482 A minimally-complete MARS consists of a core, a loader, task queues,
0483 the MARS executive function, and a way to present the final results of
0484 a battle.  Additionally, many MARS provide a "real-time" battle
0485 display and various debugging tools.
     
0486 The core consists of a cyclic list (0, 1, 2, ..., M-2, M-1, 0, 1, ...)
0487 of M MARS instructions.  The integer M is referred to as "core size".
0488 All operations are performed modulo M.  Core initialization (the
0489 initial instructions placed in core before loading warriors) is a
0490 run-time variable (see Section 4).
     
0491 The loader loads warriors into core, converting all negative field
0492 values N to positive field values P such that 0 &lt;= P &lt; M and P = kM
0493 + N for some integer k.  Subsequently, all field values G greater
0494 than or equal to M are converted to field values L = G modulo M.
0495 The loader also initializes each warrior's task queue with the
0496 appropriate task pointer.
     
0497 There is a task queue for each warrior loaded into core.  Each task
0498 queue can hold a limited number of task pointers.  The "task limit"
0499 (number of tasks an individual warrior's task queue can hold) is a
0500 run-time variable.  The task queues are FIFOs (First In, First Out).
     
0501 Each warrior consists of one task initially.  Subsequent tasks are
0502 added to the warrior's task queue using the SPL instruction.
0503 Attempted execution of a DAT instruction by a task effectively removes
0504 that task from the warrior's task queue.
     
0505 Warriors execute for a specified number of cycles ("time limit", see
0506 Section 4) or until only one warrior is still executing, whichever
0507 occurs first.  Each cycle, one instruction from each warrior is
0508 executed.  The instruction to execute is the instruction pointed to by
0509 the next task pointer in the warrior's task queue.  A warrior is no
0510 longer executing when its task queue is empty.
     
0511 The following expressions are used in describing the MARS executive
0512 function's operation.
     
0513 General Definitions:
0514    An instruction consists of an opcode, a modifier, an A-operand,
0515            and a B-operand.
0516    An A-operand consists of an A-mode and an A-number.
0517    An A-mode is the addressing mode of an A-operand.
0518    An A-number is an integer between 0 and M-1, inclusive.
0519    A B-operand consists of a B-mode and a B-number.
0520    A B-mode is the addressing mode of a B-operand.
0521    A B-number is an integer between 0 and M-1, inclusive.
     
0522 Specific Definitions:
0523    The program counter (PC) is the pointer to the location in core of
0524            the instruction fetched from core to execute.
0525    The current instruction is the instruction in the instruction
0526            register, as copied (prior to execution) from the PC
0527            location of core.
0528    The A-pointer points to the instruction the A-operand of the
0529            current instruction references in core.
0530    The A-instruction is a copy of the instruction the A-pointer
0531            points to in core (as it was during operand evaluation).
0532    The A-value is the A-number and/or the B-number of the
0533            A-instruction or the A-instruction itself, whichever are/is
0534            selected by the opcode modifier.
0535    The B-pointer points to the instruction the B-operand of the
0536            current instruction references in core.
0537    The B-instruction is a copy of the instruction the B-pointer
0538            points to in core (as it was during operand evaluation).
0539    The B-value is the A-number and/or the B-number of the
0540            B-instruction or the B-instruction itself, whichever are/is
0541            selected by the opcode modifier.
0542    The B-target is the A-number and/or the B-number of the instruction
0543            pointed to by the B-pointer or the instruction itself,
0544            whichever are/is selected by the opcode modifier.
     
0545 All MARS instructions are executed following the same procedure:
0546 1. The currently executing warrior's current task pointer is
0547    extracted from the warrior's task queue and assigned to the
0548    program counter.
0549 2. The corresponding instruction is fetched from core and stored in
0550    the instruction register as the current instruction.
0551 3. The A-operand of the current instruction is evaluated.
0552 4. The results of A-operand evaluation, the A-pointer and the
0553    A-instruction, are stored in the appropriate registers.
0554 5. The B-operand of the current instruction is evaluated.
0555 6. The results of B-operand evaluation, the B-pointer and the
0556    B-instruction, are stored in the appropriate registers.
0557 7. Operations appropriate to the opcode.modifier pair in the
0558    instruction register are executed.  With the exception of DAT
0559    instructions, all operations queue an updated task pointer.
0560    (How the task pointer is updated and when it is queued depend on
0561    instruction execution).
     
0562 All pointers are PC-relative, indicating the offset from the source of
0563 the current instruction to the desired location.  All arithmetic is to
0564 be done modulo M, with negative values converted in the same manner as
0565 during loading as discussed above (P = M + N).  Additionally, all
0566 reads of core are done modulo the read limit (R) and all writes of
0567 core are done modulo the write limit (W).  Read offsets O greater than
0568 R/2 from the current instruction are converted to backwards offsets of
0569 O = O - R.  A comparable conversion occurs for write offsets greater
0570 than W/2.
     
     
0571 <a name="5.3">5.3</a> Address Modes
     
0572 <a name="5.3.1">5.3.1</a> Immediate
0573 An immediate mode operand merely serves as storage for data.  An
0574 immediate A/B-mode in the current instruction sets the A/B-pointer to
0575 zero.
     
0576 <a name="5.3.2">5.3.2</a> Direct
0577 A direct mode operand indicates the offset from the program counter.
0578 A direct A/B-mode in the current instruction means the A/B-pointer is
0579 a copy of the offset, the A/B-number of the current instruction.
     
0580 <a name="5.3.3">5.3.3</a> Indirect
0581 An indirect mode operand indicates the primary offset (relative to the
0582 program counter) to the secondary offset (relative to the location
0583 of the instruction in which the secondary offset is contained).  An
0584 indirect A/B-mode indicates that the A/B-pointer is the sum of the
0585 A/B-number of the current instruction (the primary offset) and the
0586 B-number of the instruction pointed to by the A/B-number of the
0587 current instruction (the secondary offset).
     
0588 <a name="5.3.4">5.3.4</a> Predecrement Indirect
0589 A predecrement indirect mode operand indicates the primary offset
0590 (relative to the program counter) to the secondary offset (relative to
0591 the location of the instruction in which the secondary offset is
0592 contained) which is decremented prior to use.  A predecrement
0593 indirect A/B-mode indicates that the A/B-pointer is the sum of the
0594 A/B-number of the current instruction (the primary offset) and the
0595 decremented B-number of the instruction pointed to by the A/B-number
0596 of the current instruction (the secondary offset).
     
0597 <a name="5.3.5">5.3.5</a> Postincrement Indirect
     
0598 A postincrement indirect mode operand indicates the primary offset
0599 (relative to the program counter) to the secondary offset (relative to
0600 the location of the instruction in which the secondary offset is
0601 contained) which is incremented after the results of the operand
0602 evaluation are stored.  A postincrement indirect A/B-mode indicates that
0603 the A/B-pointer is the sum of the A/B-number of the current instruction
0604 (the primary offset) and the B-number of the instruction pointed to by
0605 the A/B-number of the current instruction (the secondary offset).  The
0606 B-number of the instruction pointed to by the A/B-number of the current
0607 instruction is incremented after the A/B-instruction is stored, but
0608 before the B-operand is evaluated (for post-increment A-mode), or
0609 the operation is executed (for post-increment indirect B-mode).
     
     
0610 <a name="5.4">5.4</a> Modifiers
     
0611 <a name="5.4.1">5.4.1</a> A
0612 Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the A-number of
0613 the A-instruction and the B-value set to the A-number of the
0614 B-instruction.  A write to core replaces the A-number of the
0615 instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.
     
0616 For example, a CMP.A instruction would compare the A-number of the
0617 A-instruction with the A-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.A
0618 instruction would replace the A-number of the instruction pointed to
0619 by the B-pointer with the A-number of the A-instruction.
     
0620 <a name="5.4.2">5.4.2</a> B
0621 Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the B-number of
0622 the A-instruction and the B-value set to the B-number of the
0623 B-instruction.  A write to core replaces the B-number of the
0624 instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.
     
0625 For example, a CMP.B instruction would compare the B-number of the
0626 A-instruction with the B-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.B
0627 instruction would replace the B-number of the instruction pointed to
0628 by the B-pointer with the B-number of the A-instruction.
     
0629 <a name="5.4.3">5.4.3</a> AB
0630 Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the A-number of
0631 the A-instruction and the B-value set to the B-number of the
0632 B-instruction.  A write to core replaces the B-number of the
0633 instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.
     
0634 For example, a CMP.AB instruction would compare the A-number of the
0635 A-instruction with the B-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.AB
0636 instruction would replace the B-number of the instruction pointed to
0637 by the B-pointer with the A-number of the A-instruction.
     
0638 <a name="5.4.4">5.4.4</a> BA
0639 Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the B-number of
0640 the A-instruction and the B-value set to the A-number of the
0641 B-instruction.  A write to core replaces the A-number of the
0642 instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.
     
0643 For example, a CMP.BA instruction would compare the B-number of the
0644 A-instruction with the A-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.BA
0645 instruction would replace the A-number of the instruction pointed to
0646 by the B-pointer with the B-number of the A-instruction.
     
0647 <a name="5.4.5">5.4.5</a> F
0648 Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to both the
0649 A-number and B-number of the A-instruction (in that order) and the
0650 B-value set to both the A-number and B-number of the B-instruction
0651 (also in that order).  A write to core replaces both the A-number and
0652 the B-number of the instruction pointed to by the B-pointer (in that
0653 order).
     
0654 For example, a CMP.F instruction would compare the A-number of the
0655 A-instruction to the A-number of the B-instruction and the B-number of
0656 the A-instruction to B-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.F instruction
0657 would replace the A-number of the instruction pointed to by the
0658 B-pointer with the A-number of the A-instruction and would also replace
0659 the B-number of the instruction pointed to by the B-pointer with the
0660 B-number of the A-instruction.
     
0661 <a name="5.4.6">5.4.6</a> X
0662 Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to both the
0663 A-number and B-number of the A-instruction (in that order) and the
0664 B-value set to both the B-number and A-number of the B-instruction
0665 (in that order).  A write to to core replaces both the B-number and
0666 the A-number of the instruction pointed to by the B-pointer (in that
0667 order).
     
0668 For example, a CMP.X instruction would compare the A-number of the
0669 A-instruction to the B-number of the B-instruction and the B-number of the
0670 A-instruction to A-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.X instruction would
0671 replace the B-number of the instruction pointed to by the B-pointer with the
0672 A-number of the A-instruction and would also replace the A-number of the
0673 instruction pointed to by the B-pointer with the B-number of the
0674 A-instruction.
     
0675 <a name="5.4.7">5.4.7</a> I
0676 Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the
0677 A-instruction and the B-value set to the B-instruction.  A write to
0678 core replaces the entire instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.
     
0679 For example, a CMP.I instruction would compare the A-instruction to
0680 the B-instruction.  A MOV.I instruction would replace the instruction
0681 pointed to by the B-pointer with the A-instruction.
     
     
0682 <a name="5.5">5.5</a> Instruction Set
     
0683 <a name="5.5.1">5.5.1</a> DAT
0684 No additional processing takes place.  This effectively removes the
0685 current task from the current warrior's task queue.
     
0686 <a name="5.5.2">5.5.2</a> MOV
0687 Move replaces the B-target with the A-value and queues the next
0688 instruction (PC + 1).
     
0689 <a name="5.5.3">5.5.3</a> ADD
0690 ADD replaces the B-target with the sum of the A-value and the B-value
0691 (A-value + B-value) and queues the next instruction (PC + 1).  ADD.I
0692 functions as ADD.F would.
     
0693 <a name="5.5.4">5.5.4</a> SUB
0694 SUB replaces the B-target with the difference of the B-value and the
0695 A-value (B-value - A-value) and queues the next instruction (PC + 1).
0696 SUB.I functions as SUB.F would.
     
0697 <a name="5.5.5">5.5.5</a> MUL
0698 MUL replaces the B-target with the product of the A-value and the
0699 B-value (A-value * B-value) and queues the next instruction (PC + 1).
0700 MUL.I functions as MUL.F would.
     
0701 <a name="5.5.6">5.5.6</a> DIV
0702 DIV replaces the B-target with the integral result of dividing the
0703 B-value by the A-value (B-value / A-value) and queues the next
0704 instruction (PC + 1).  DIV.I functions as DIV.F would. If the
0705 A-value is zero, the B-value is unchanged and the current task is
0706 removed from the warrior's task queue.
     
0707 <a name="5.5.7">5.5.7</a> MOD
0708 MOD replaces the B-target with the integral remainder of dividing the
0709 B-value by the A-value (B-value % A-value) and queues the next
0710 instruction (PC + 1).  MOD.I functions as MOD.F would. If the
0711 A-value is zero, the B-value is unchanged and the current task is
0712 removed from the warrior's task queue.
     
0713 <a name="5.5.8">5.5.8</a> JMP
0714 JMP queues the sum of the program counter and the A-pointer.
     
0715 <a name="5.5.9">5.5.9</a> JMZ
0716 JMZ tests the B-value to determine if it is zero.  If the B-value is
0717 zero, the sum of the program counter and the A-pointer is queued.
0718 Otherwise, the next instruction is queued (PC + 1).  JMZ.I functions
0719 as JMZ.F would, i.e. it jumps if both the A-number and the B-number
0720 of the B-instruction are zero.
     
0721 <a name="5.5.10">5.5.10</a> JMN
0722 JMN tests the B-value to determine if it is zero.  If the B-value is
0723 not zero, the sum of the program counter and the A-pointer is queued.
0724 Otherwise, the next instruction is queued (PC + 1).  JMN.I functions
0725 as JMN.F would, i.e. it jumps if both the A-number and the B-number
0726 of the B-instruction are non-zero. This is not the negation of the
0727 condition for JMZ.F.
     
0728 <a name="5.5.11">5.5.11</a> DJN
0729 DJN decrements the B-value and the B-target, then tests the B-value
0730 to determine if it is zero.  If the decremented B-value is not zero,
0731 the sum of the program counter and the A-pointer is queued.
0732 Otherwise, the next instruction is queued (PC + 1).  DJN.I functions
0733 as DJN.F would, i.e. it decrements both both A/B-numbers of the B-value
0734 and the B-target, and jumps if both A/B-numbers of the B-value are
0735 non-zero.
     
0736 <a name="5.5.12">5.5.12</a> CMP
0737 CMP compares the A-value to the B-value.  If the result of the
0738 comparison is equal, the instruction after the next instruction
0739 (PC + 2) is queued (skipping the next instruction).  Otherwise, the
0740 the next instruction is queued (PC + 1).
     
0741 <a name="5.5.13">5.5.13</a> SLT
0742 SLT compares the A-value to the B-value.  If the A-value is less than
0743 the B-value, the instruction after the next instruction (PC + 2) is
0744 queued (skipping the next instruction).  Otherwise, the next
0745 instruction is queued (PC + 1).  SLT.I functions as SLT.F would.
     
0746 <a name="5.5.14">5.5.14</a> SPL
0747 SPL queues the next instruction (PC + 1) and then queues the sum of
0748 the program counter and A-pointer. If the queue is full, only the
0749 next instruction is queued.

1474 <a name="A">A.</a> Differences Between Standards
     
1475 <a name="A1">A.1</a> Purpose
1476 This appendix lists some of the major differences between this standard
1477 and those standards which preceded it.  The purpose is to help those
1478 who are familiar with a previous standard or standards to quickly
1479 understand those items which are new or have changed.
     
     
1480 <a name="A2">A.2</a> Changes
     
1481 <a name="A2.1">A.2.1</a> Assembly Files
1482 A comma is required for operand separation.
     
1483 Parenthetical expressions are allowed.
     
1484 There is a new pseudo-opcode, ORG, for specifying the first logical
1485 instruction.
     
1486 There is a new operator, modulus '%', for determining the remainder
1487 of integer division.
     
1488 <a name="A2.1.1">A.2.1.1</a> ICWS'86 to ICWS'94 Conversion
1489 If a modifier is missing, it is assembled according to conversion
1490 rules that depend on whether the ICWS'86 or '88 standard is emulated.
1491 By default, a MARS should use the ICWS'88 conversion rules. Emulation
1492 of ICWS'86 is optional.
