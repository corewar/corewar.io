# Coreware

HTML5 & javascript implementation of the classic game [corewar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War)

Currently this project contains a redcode parser and core simulator

In future we hope to include a corewar IDE with debugger, an interactive core simulation and a number of hills

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, `npm install` to get the dependencies.

You may need `webpack-dev-server` installed globally if you don't have it already.

Run `npm start` to fire up the dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/corewar`

## Testing

Corewar is extensively unit tested, run `npm test` to execute the tests and see the coverage.

You may need `jasmine-cli` installed globally if you don't have it already
