    <h3>1. Core Concepts</h3>
    <p>
      Corewar is a coding game where you battle programs or 'warriors' against each other. The objective
      is to destroy the opposing warrior by causing them to execute a 'DAT' command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each round the warriors take turn executing instructions until one of them is destroyed or the number of cycles
      for the round elapses.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical battle takes places over X rounds and the overall win/lose/draw ratio is reported as the result.
      In a hill, each warrior is pitted against each other warrior and the results are used to determine a ranking.
      The bottom warrior each time is removed from the hill, leaving the others in place to face new challengers.

    <h3>1.1 Corewar.io</h3>
    <p>
      Corewar.io allows you to write, debug and battle your warriors on our online platform. We noticed that whilst
      there are many Corewar implementations they all tend to ask the user to download specific programs and these
      programs tend to be operating system specific. Corewar.io allows you to play Corewar without any downloads on
      any platform, including mobile and tablet devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment we are in a public beta stage for the parser and simulator features where we will be gathering
      feedback and ideas to improve the system going forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the near future we will be adding features from our <a href='/#roadmap'>Roadmap</a> including:
      <ul>
        <li>User logins allowing you to save and load your users accross sessions</li>
        <li>Online hills with real time result reports</li>
        <li>Personalised hills where you control the entrants, allowing you to play with your friends</li>
      </ul>
